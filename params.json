{"name":"Netland","tagline":"A comprehensive tool for simulation and visualization of transcriptional network kinetics","body":"NetLand is a tool for kinetic modeling and visualization of Waddington’s epigenetic landscape. It is applied for modeling and simulating the kinetic dynamics of transcriptional regulatory networks. \r\n\r\nThe global system dynamics which determine cell state transition are abstracted from transcriptional regulations and visualized in Waddington’s epigenetic landscape. It provides flexible simulation methods and landscape implementations, i.e. probabilistic landscape representing the stability of cells. The landscape can be visualized by mapping to two marker genes or a two-dimensional latent space by using a dimension reduction method, GPDM. \r\n\r\nThe software NetLand is written in Java, with a graphical user interface (GUI).\r\n\r\n### Release Information\r\nCurrent release is 1.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
